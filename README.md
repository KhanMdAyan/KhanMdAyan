# 👋 Hi, I'm Ayan Khan

💻 Entry-Level Software Developer | Backend-Focused Engineer


I’m a Software Developer with hands-on experience building end-to-end applications using Java and Python, with a strong focus on backend systems and database design.

I enjoy designing scalable architectures, building RESTful APIs, and solving real-world problems using clean, maintainable code. 

 During my internship as a Backend Trainee, I worked on building scalable backend systems using Django and MongoDB, developing RESTful APIs and integrating databases in real-world environments. Alongside practical experience, I’ve strengthened my problem-solving and analytical skills through certifications in Data Structures (University of Michigan), Google Data Analytics, and many more. I have also gained a lot of experience working as a free lancer. This combination of applied backend development and solid theoretical knowledge, and multiple freelance projects enables me to design efficient, maintainable, and scalable software systems.
